# Executive-Dashboard-in-Power-BI-A-Unified-View-of-HR-Marketing-and-Sales-Insights

## Project Overview
The Executive Dashboard was developed to provide business leaders with a centralised view of key organisational functions—HR, Marketing, and Sales. The goal was to enable data-driven decision-making by tracking performance metrics across departments in one consolidated Power BI solution.

---

## Objectives
- Build a unified dashboard to support executive-level monitoring.
- Provide actionable insights on employee performance, marketing campaign effectiveness, and sales growth.
- Create a scalable and interactive data model using Power BI.

---

  ## Tools & Technologies
- Power BI – Data modeling, visualisation, and dashboard creation
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Calculated columns and measures for KPIs

---

## Analysis Process

### 1. Data Collection & Cleaning
 - Imported datasets into Power BI from Excel/CSV.
- Standardised column names, handled duplicates and missing values.

### 2. KPI Definition
- **Sales:** Revenue, profit, profit margin, average order value, top customers & regions.
- **HR:** Employee headcount, attrition rate, average tenure, department distribution.
- **Marketing:** Campaign ROI, CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost), channel effectiveness.

### 3. Dashboard Design
- **Sales Dashboard**: Revenue trends, regional sales, top products, sales channel distribution.
- **HR Dashboard**: Workforce demographics, attrition trends, performance distribution.
- **Marketing Dashboard**: Average ROI, channel performance, CAC, conversion rate.

## Key Insights
- 𝐒𝐚𝐥𝐞𝐬: Revenue reached $5.02M with a 50.7% profit margin, but sales were almost evenly split across new and returning customers, meaning customer retention is flat.
- 𝐇𝐑: Total headcount stood at 1,470, with an attrition rate of 16.1%. The sales department alone had a 38.5% attrition rate, a level of turnover that directly threatens customer relationships, revenue consistency, and team performance.
- 𝐌𝐚𝐫𝐤𝐞𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠: $2.5B was spent across campaigns, but conversion rates hovered around 8% for all channels. There was no standout performer, and CAC showed minor monthly fluctuations, ranging from $283 to $288.

## Recommendations
- Launch a retention campaign targeting existing customers with follow-ups, loyalty offers, or exclusive content.
- Introduce stay interviews for top performers in high-turnover departments to understand what’s keeping them and what might push them out.
- Pilot new campaign approaches (e.g., offer types, ad formats, messaging) and track impact over a 60-day test.
